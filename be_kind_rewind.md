**Cashless society** is dedicated to building a kinder, stronger money. 

Money is a social construct. A game we play. In recent years we have discovered there are actually many games that we can play that are like money.

Alternative currencies and scripts have existed since the 1800s. Mutual credit has existed since the 1980s. Crypto currencies since 2008. All of these are games that are 'like' money but different rules.

Some money games have a government mandate - we must pay our taxes using state money. Some games carry within them an incentive to play that game - you choose to join a TimeBank and freely exchange services with others. 

### Kinder money

But if we are creating new games, why not choose a game that allows us to be human - that allows us to express our solidarity for other members of our community while at the same time giving us a way to make a living. Above all, why not design a type of money that is kind and fair? 

How would that look? Well, for one thing, let's create a game that doesn't carry within it an unfair advantage that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.

Secondly, let's create a game that let's people express their kindness. We believe that if we give people the tools to create a game that allows them to be generous and supportive they will do so.

### Relationships vs Tokens 

I'm a regular guy who has also worked with some of the richest fund managers and banks in the world. One thing I've noticed is that to 'regular folks' money is a token. Payment might be electronic, but ultimately your bank account is a purse filled with coins that you can then give to others. But to the richest people and certainly to the banks and financial institutions money is a relationship - money is made of obligations and assets. People or institutions that owe you money balanced with obligations you have to others. People in your employ or assets that earn you money. 

Credit and reserves are like a ship and its sails. Reserves are the watertight hull, and if you're lucky enough to have a strong boat, then you can ride out a loss of a job or another economic storm. Credit is like the sails in good weather they are essential - the relationships that carry you to new opportunities. Trying to start a business or do something different without credit is almost impossible. 

*The fundamental mission of Cashless is to democratize credit.*

We aim to eliminate the gatekeepers, instead of asking a bank for credit, we ultimately want to build a world in which you ask your community for permission to build a new opportunity or business.

This means teaching people how to think of money as a relationship. That money can actually be *created* within those relationships. 

### Crypto and Cashless 

Crypto has done a fantastic job of democratizing and decentralizing reserves. Cashless wants to do that for credit, building on the work of the mutual credit movement, but in a new, more principled way. 

The crypto community is now moving into 'decentralized finance' building tools like insurance and lending on top of the programmable reserves infrastructure that is blockchain. In some ways Cashless is proud to be just another part of this 'de-fi' revolution. 

However we are somewhat different our mission is dedicated to building kinder games with money -  money that is strong but also allows us to be human. Cashless is human first strenth second. 

We are also different because just as retail banks 'settle' most debts between themselves each night (without needing to use reserve bank currency) we are building a system that lets our members 'settle' most (but not all) credit relationships amongst ourselves without reference to the block chain.

### Messaging based, decentralized UX 

Cashless has roots within the mutual aid movement. One of the the big lessons we learned from that experience is that people want to build their organisations and communities by wiring up different pieces of tech in various ways. Cashless is commited to building tools that are decentralized and non-monolithic. 

That means we want to build bots that can join your discord,  that can let you post a message successfully sending money (or credit) to another person in your organisation without even having to come to 'our' site. We also want to let you run your own version of our software. Of course we will need a website, but we want to build tools that let 'mutual credit' appear as just 'one more column' in people's adhoc Airtable and let them design the tools the way they want.

### Decentralized organisation - be kind, trust the science

Cashless is a global open source organisation, but it also has roots in New Zealand and builds on technology invented in New Zealand.  Recently, New Zealand successfully squashed their COVID outbreak by using an approach which can be summarized as *"be kind, go hard, trust the science"* 

If our mission is to make the world better a better place *"be kind" should be a core of what we do*. We must practice this internally, in how we work with our own,, but also in the way that our tools work and the products work.

Trusting the science means taking the time to properly write up our approaches and get peer-review of our mathematical and economic models. There is pressure to to build fast ('go hard') if we want to succeed, but also the entire domain of money and trust is also too important to do in a rush. We must be sure of our approaches and support our work with mathematically principled work. 

### Governance tokens and 'exit to community' 

One thing to admit is we tried the angel / vc funded startup approach already. However having done that for a bit, we've decided to go for a more decentralized startup approach now. The exact form of this approach is still a work in progress but it will be inspired by the work of people like [Mark Pascall](https://medium.com/@mark_pascall/using-blockchain-dao-token-economics-to-create-a-pure-teal-startup-a-practical-guide-534a373d7b1b), [Colony](https://colony.io/), and other related effort.s For now we're keeping things simple by

- meeting on discord 
- building real solutions and seing how they get used 
- keeping our code open source
- progressively distributing governance tokens to the community over multiple years 

(I'll remove this next bit, but fwiw this is what JV of enspiral had to say:

> I’m a big fan of both governance tokens and exit to community. I really rate what Balancer labs and Nexus mutual teams are doing in this space. I have less time for all the ‘pure dao’ folks - daostack, aragon etc.
>
> The model I see working currently is a core team who raises money, funds initial development and then progressively distributes governance tokens to a community over multiple years while building up the community capacity to self govern.
> I’ve only seen folks starting, I haven’t yet seen a successful exit to community  - Joshua Vial
